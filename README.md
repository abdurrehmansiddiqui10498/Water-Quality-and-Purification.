# Water-Quality-and-Purification.

# This is a basic project in which we can monitor the quality of water by the help of Arduino UNO as a brain. We use additional component that are Breadboard, TDS meter and sensor and Temperature sensor. We use a 9 volt battery and Jumper wires for connectivity (male to female , male to male and Female to female)
